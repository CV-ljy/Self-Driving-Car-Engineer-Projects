## Demonstration


### 1. [Finding Lane Lines](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P1-Finding-Lane-Lines)
Use basic computer vision techniques, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform for instance, to detect lanes in some video streams taken from a running car.
