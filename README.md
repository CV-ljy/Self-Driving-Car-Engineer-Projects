### 1. [Finding Lane Lines](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P1-Finding-Lane-Lines)
Use basic computer vision techniques, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform for instance, to detect lanes in some video streams taken from a running car.

### 4. [Advanced Lane Finding](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P4-Advanced-Lane-Finding)
Use advanced computer vision algorithm such as Sobel Edge Detection, Perspective Transform, to percisely locate the towards lanes next to our vehicle.

### 5. [Vehicle Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P5-Vehicle-Detection-And-Tracking)
Use HOG and color histogram features extrated from vehicle and non-vehicle images to train a SVM classifier. Implement a sliding windows to find and use SVC to detect vehicle positions.

### 6. [Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P6-Extended-Kalman-Filter)
An extended kalman filter is implemented to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

### 7. [Unscented Kalman Filter](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P7-Unscented-Kalman-Filter)
An unscented kalman filter is implemented to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

### 9. [PID Control](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P9-PID-Control)
A PID controller is implemented, which collects data and attempts to minimize the error (CTE in this case) over time by adjustment of a control variable u(t) (steering value in this case).

### 10. [Model Pridictive Control](https://github.com/joeyzhong90595/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Projects/tree/master/P10-MPC)
A Model Pridictive Controller (MPC) is implemented, which differs from PID control that is an optimized problem, but simulates different actuators input and predicts future vehicle trajectory in order to find the best trajectory with a minimum cost.
